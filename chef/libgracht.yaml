    A lightweight, cross-platform, low-dependency, and modular protocol/rpc library. 
    Gracht is built upon an abstracted concept of links, which can be anything and hence allows gracht to work on any platform. 
    The links that are provided by default are unix/windows-sockets and a native interface for the Vali 
    OS IPC (which the library is originally built for). Gracht protocols are defined in the in its own format.
